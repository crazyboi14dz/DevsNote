# DevsNote
Its  Devsnest Hackathon Project.

# In Our Drop Zone a message dropped camed from Kshitiz Sir(13:04 PM):
Hello all. Hope you are doing great! Some news for the coming weeks:

1. Hackathons! Starting this weekend! All the information about it will be given to you tomorrow! Hope you are ready. you would need to be in a group of max 4 people to participate (not necessarily your teammates). Start finding your partners for all the late-night VC dev work you guys will be doing.💯

2. I am working on making sure everyone gets the best experience for peer learning in Devsnest. here are some quick links for getting your problems solved:
📌 Our Discord Link: https://devsnest.in/discord
📌 To understand everything, take the intro call that happens at 4pm and 7pm and sometimes at 11pm also: https://discord.gg/qp92jVn9
📌checkout #introduce-yourself, #announcements, #main, #course-doubts and #bug-reports-and-ideas text channels. Names are pretty self-explanatory.

3. if you have any problems tag @moderators to seek help. if it isn't getting resolved by them seek help from @admin. If you still have a problem you can tag me @KSHITIZ to look into the concerns.
NOTE: Make sure you use the #need-mod-help text channel only for this.

4. Want to encourage people to have fun and at the same time have a sense of welcoming others. welcome new people and make new friends. Avoid any jokes which could make anyone else a bit hesitant. Report any concern as directed in point 3.

5. For coming Monday and Tuesday, I will be overtaking the frontend boot camp to teach you, GIT, 😄 See you at 8:30pm IST.👋🏻

6. The most IMPORTANT news: We are double downing on getting people hired from the community ASAP for the coming months. There will be 1-2 events every week to make sure you understand what it means to be Interview Ready and how to do that. Want your entire focus on them. Will share more details soon!

Please support the effort so that we can find more and more companies for you all!
